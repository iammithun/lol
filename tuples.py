#Tuple
#Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

#uple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

#A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

#Tuples are written with round brackets.
thistuples=("apple","banana","cherry","apple","cherry")
print(thistuple)
#tuples lenght
thistuple=("apple","banana","cherry")
print(len(thistuples))
#Create Tuple With One Item
thistuple = ("apple",)
print(type(thistuple))

#NOT a tuple
thistuple = ("apple")
print(type(thistuple))
#To create a tuple with only one item, you have to add a comma after the item, otherwise Python will not recognize it as a tuple.
